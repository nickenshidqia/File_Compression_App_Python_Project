# Python Project of File Compression Application

## Project Description

**Problem :**  
Managing and transferring multiple files can become cumbersome due to their size and the need for efficient storage and transportation. To address this issue, there is a requirement for a file compression application that allows users to select multiple files, and compress them into a single ZIP file.

**Challenges :**  
Build a Zip File Compression Application that allows users to bundling files together for easier sharing, storage, or backup.

## Project Goal

Provide an intuitive user interface that allows users to select multiple files for compression.
